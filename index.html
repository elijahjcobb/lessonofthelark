                    <p>The Lesson of the Lark is an important tool in the struggle to educate the public on the lack of legal equality for women in the United States; but it is more than that, Ms. Cobb’s poetic treatment of the history of American women’s struggle for dignity, justice and equality reverberates in today’s fraught environment and urges us not simply to learn from our past and strive for a better future, but to listen and learn from the wisdom within. The Lesson of the Lark will provide boys, girls, young women and young men with a beautiful and profound allegory as well as spiritual guidance to realize the next phase of human evolution through tolerance, compassion and love.</p>
