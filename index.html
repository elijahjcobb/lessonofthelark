                <p><b>THE LESSON OF THE LARK</b> is a moving one-sit, historical fiction picture book for children and teens. It celebrates the centennial of the Nineteenth Ammendment of the United States constitution. Richly written in prose, this story teaches the importance of equality and tolerance through the eyes of a girl, a lark, and a gardener. It inspires readers to let their conscience be their guide by following the golden rule. It challenges readers to stand up, and take action for what they believe in. It offers words of wisdom about the traedy of discrimination. Through symbolism and metaphor, this story speaks of integrity and perseverance. This beautifully crafted book serves as a testament to liberty, and the dire need for compassion and balance for humanity.</p>

                    <p>The Lesson of the Lark is an important tool in the struggle to educate the public on the lack of legal equality for women in the United States; but it is more than that, Ms. Cobb’s poetic treatment of the history of American women’s struggle for dignity, justice and equality reverberates in today’s fraught environment and urges us not simply to learn from our past and strive for a better future, but to listen and learn from the wisdom within. The Lesson of the Lark will provide boys, girls, young women and young men with a beautiful and profound allegory as well as spiritual guidance to realize the next phase of human evolution through tolerance, compassion and love.</p>
